To use this project, create a new directory and place all of the contents in it. 

Ideally, create a directory listing as follows:
	flask_project/
		static/
		templates/
		app.py
		app.pyc
		config.cfg
		requirements.txt

to install the requirements, navigate to the flask_project directory and run the command > pip install -r reqirements.txt in the shell.
